                <!--Here I learnt how to link a specific part of a page to the buttons in my menu bar.
                    I learnt this on this website: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp
                    The 'Contact' button doesn't lead to anything when I press it, though, despite me including a section for it at the bottom of the page.-->

                It helped me to make everything fit how I wanted it to.
            However, I put it in black in my first draft of the website and when I try to switch it to white to suit the new colour I've added,
        I hit a wall. I can change colours of other text except this and I can't identify why, leaving the home page looking quite off. Update: figured out a way to change the colour,
        but then it effects the colour of the rest of the website's body.-->
